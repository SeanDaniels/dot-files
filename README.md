# Motivation
I have multiple personal machines and a single work machine. I would like to unify the configurations of the tools I use most frequently.

# Configurations
- Bash
- Emacs
- Vim
- Tmux
- Zsh
- Windows Terminal

# TODO
- [ ] Work mail configuration
    - mbsync profile
    - directory structure for mail
- [ ] Org agenda/journal configuration
    - directory structure
